    ```
    Parameters
    * [category]: The category to which the command belongs (e.g., manage, workbook).
    * [command]: The specific action you want to perform (e.g., create, append, enroll).
    * [options]: Additional parameters or flags that modify the command. (e.g. -h(host), -l(location)).
    See [below](#Details) for more information about parameters.
2. Use the menu options to create new assignments, manage grades, or sync with EJP-S and EJP-BE.
